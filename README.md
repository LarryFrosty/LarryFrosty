so apparently you can put a README file on your profile, cool.

hi! i'm just a little fella making their way through life. i like programming, usually in Haxe, and i also chart FNF/non-FNF songs.
i like playing rhythm games, and i'm mainly focused on Friday Night Funkin' as i currently enjoy it. my favorite mods are Vs. Dave & Bambi and Pibby: Apocalypse.
i don't do a lot on github, it's mostly me testing stuff on a psych engine fork to add whatever i want.
